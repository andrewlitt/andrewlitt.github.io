<p>Well - this is it, I made a thing.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about it for awhile now, actually. But the way I wanted it was always what held it up - no Wordpress, I wanted to build the site myself. Make a project out of it. I can code!</p>
<p>So after a few winter breaks of half-assing it, I finally found the time to make fire up the engines for real. I decided to make it using the same tools as another project I did - shout out to <a href="http://queensbluebird.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">queensbluebird.ca</a> - and I got cracking. Maybe I’ll do another post for the nerds with those details.</p>
<p>But the real shout out goes to my wisdom teeth. Without the incredibly boring week that followed their departure, I would’ve found anything more fun than the coding to do. Thanks boys, I won’t miss you.</p>
<p>So yeah, thing’s made. Welcome to my internet corner, read around as it (hopefully) grows. Hopefully, one day I’ll write better content than a YouTube comment section. A man can dream.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p><em>Litt</em></p>
