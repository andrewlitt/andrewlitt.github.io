<h2 id="The-Project"><a href="#The-Project" class="headerlink" title="The Project"></a>The Project</h2><p>This project was for my capstone design course at Queenâ€™s, ELEC 490. My scope was focused on creating a control system with an Altera FPGA - in this application, we used Sine-Triangle Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM).</p>
<p>Our task was this: design and implementation of a single-phase inverter for converting direct-current (DC) electricity from solar panels into alternating current (AC). The AC output would be used to drive a load, or for connection to supply an electrical grid.</p>
<p>After completing initial background research, it was decided to work with a full-bridge switching topology for the main inverter circuit. With this, a functional simulation of an inverter circuit was created in PSIM. It consisted of a resistive load and a closed-loop control system using a proportional-resonant (PR) controller. From these simulations, a full schematic and printed circuit board (PCB) layout was created in Altium Designer to implement the system, along with support circuitry for driving MOSFET switches and for current and voltage sensing.</p>
<p>Once the system was designed, it was implemented on the four-layer PCB. During this process, an open-loop control system implementing sinusoidal pulse-width modulation (SPWM) was written in VHDL for use on an Altera DE0 FPGA.</p>
<p>Testing of the system was done using a Chroma Power Analyzer in the ePOWER lab of Walter Light Hall. Under testing conditions, the completed system demonstrated a 93% efficiency, a THD of 14.05%, and a unity power factor using a resistive load.</p>
